# RageMP-Server

It's a big project of the game server based on RageMP (GTA V modification framework).

Backend of the server has been created using .NET (C#), and the Frontend in CSS/HTML/JS.
UI is responsive only for desktop resolutions (supporting ultra wide).

There are many features included in the project that extend users experience in the game.

Server requires a database to work. It's not included in the repository.


The project is currently suspended, but there is a high possibility that I will continue working on it in the future.
