# RageMP-Server

This was my long-time project.
I was basically implementing a game server based on a RageMP which extends GTA:V.

Many thing are done here, it's almost playable as a RPG server. Any questions, regarding the code or the server itself, 
can be asked here on github, or on my personal Discord: MeHow#6876.

You can do whatever you want to do with it, I don't really care :D
